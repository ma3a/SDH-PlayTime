# Project Archive Notice

This project is being archived due to time constraints that have prevented me from maintaining it, despite my strong interest and enthusiasm for its development. There are several features and enhancements that I had hoped to implement, but unfortunately, I am unable to continue working on them at this time.
I encourage anyone interested in the project to explore the existing codebase and contribute if they wish. Thank you for your understanding and support.

# PlayTime

![PlayTime Logo](assets/image.png)

PlayTime is a plugin for the SteamDeck gaming console, designed to track the amount of time you spend playing games. It provides weekly and monthly reports, as well as an overall summary of your gaming time. In addition, it offers data migration from the SteamLessTimes and MetaDeck plugins. PlayTime also allows you to manually adjust your overall playtime through the settings.

## Installation

The best way to get plugin is to use official Decky Plugin Store (https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/).

To install PlayTime manually:

1. Go to the [PlayTime GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/PlayTime).
2. Download the latest release package (ZIP format).
3. Copy the zip file to SteamDeck and install it from Decky loader.

Alternatively, you can build PlayTime from source by following these steps:

1. Clone the PlayTime repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ma3a/SDH-PlayTime.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd SDH-PlayTime
   ```

3. If you want to deploy the plugin directly to the Deck, use the following command instead:
   ```shell
   make deploy
   ```

   Make sure your SteamDeck is connected and properly set up for development.
